# Port Management Rule

- Always close all open ports before starting the dev server or any process that binds to a port.
- Always use the default port 3000 for local development unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
- If port 3000 is in use, prompt the user to close the process or free the port, rather than auto-incrementing to 3001, 3002, etc.
- This ensures predictable local URLs and avoids confusion with multiple running instances.
